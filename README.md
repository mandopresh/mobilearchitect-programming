Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The Event Tracker app is designed to help users stay organized by being able to create events, schedule appointments and eventually set reminders. With the current interface,
it ensures users can effortlessly manage their schedules and keep track of important dates. The goal of this app is to provide a seamless and accessible way for users to stay on top of
their day to day responsibilities which promotes productivity and good time management. 

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

There were three screens necessary for executing the app how it was intended. The login screen, the home screen and the screen where the events are created and editted. When creating my UI 
designs, I kept the user thoughts in mind. Creating a back button and logout button for common things that are typically looked for on an app.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?

The approach I used was centered around understanding the user's needs and expectations first. I aimed to create a user-friendly application that required little to no
training, ensuring a seamless experience. To keep organized and minimize errors, I outlined a clear list of features and adhered to it throughout the process. This
structured approach kept me focused and on schedule. Given its effectiveness, I plan to apply these strategies to future projects to maintain efficiency and ensure high quality results.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?

Something that I found very useful throughout this project was coding and testing in parts. I made sure not to implement too much before testing it first to see if the app would function or run. 
Anytime I found the app not run, I would go back and fix my code to the point where everything was running and start again until getting a successful output.

Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

One part of the app I found challenging was the SMS verification part of it. Initially, I had intended to create an entire new screen to ask for text and approval before entering the home but 
because of time and difficulty getting it to work as I wanted I ended up going a different route. I believe it did affect my overall grade for the project and it's something that I would possibly
do differently if I was ever given another similar project.

In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I really enjoyed working on the event activity screen. Making it so that you can create an event and then adding a function to delete and then to edit was very pleasing. It felt very rewarding to be 
able to run my app and see it work as intended and I feel like I expressed my knowledge the best here.
